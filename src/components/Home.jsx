              The Usual Suspects is a 1995 crime thriller film directed by Bryan
              Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie. It stars Stephen
              Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Chazz
              Palminteri, The film was shot on a $6 million budget and began as
              a title taken from a column in Spy magazine called The Usual
              Suspects, after one of Claude Rains' most memorable lines in the
              classic film Casablanca, and Singer thought that it would make a
              good title for a film.
